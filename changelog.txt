v1.2.2
 - bugfix for fitter.fit_model where negative parameter values are now handled correctly
 - submodules are now imported immediately upon package import
 - fitter.fit_model now warns you if you are not constraining the result and returns null errors rather than crash or produce garbage
 - added some checks for data and hessian quality in error handling for fitter.fit_model
 - default sun position changed to left-handed coordinate system for consistency
 - added sampler.perturb_value() for noise generation in quantity arrays

v1.2.1
 - added density function to NFW model
 - fixed vertical acceleration of exponential disk
 - bug fix in models.atan() and models.a_gal_sph()

v1.2.0
 - model params set to None are now correctly disabled on init
 - fixed bug in distance calculation for convenience.pdot_shk()
 - model keyword args can now be passed into, for example, galpy potentials through model.alos([...], phi=my_phi) etc.
 - icrs to gal, cart conversion using frame kwarg now works correctly
 - added support for galpy potentials that cannot take arrays as inputs
 - added RadialDensityOscillation model
 - added noise models to the optimizer

v1.1.0
 - edited README.md
 - made changes to docstrings to improve readthedocs
 - added model.atan() and model.a_gal_sph() functions to calculate proper accelerations
 - added convenience.dot and convenience.mags helper functions
 - added CoxGomezSpiralArm potential to Models
 - changed UniformAccel Model to UniformAlos
 - added Uniform3DAccel Model
 - fixed bug in models.a_gal_sph() by changing np.put -> np.place, which can take conditions instead of indices
 - fixed bug in fit chi^2 statistic calculation, is now correct
 - fixed bug in fix_arrays() wrapper that caused things to break when not running the docs generator

v1.0.0
 - put out public repo release on Pypi
 - changed a bunch of readthedocs and documentation stuff
 - changed the way that default/disabled parameters work to fix fitter.fit_model()
 - added model.get_param_default() method for some 
 - fitter catches singular matrices in the hessian so you can debug
 - added UniformAccel model

v0.0.9
 - bug fix in convenience.alos_obs()

v0.0.8
 - Added Plummer profile to models
 - some bug fixes in models and convenience
 - added optional parameters in models, reworked some class stuff to make that work
 - QuillenVariableVcirc has now been absorbed into QuillenFlexible
 - QuillenFlexible has been renamed OortExpansion
 - added sun_pos kwarg to model.alos(), is also passed through anything that uses the convert_to_frame decorator
 - altered sphinx code and directory setup so everything is on RTD now, no local build to worry about or push to git

v0.0.7
 - Added sampler.py module
 - added radial power law and uniform samplers to sampler module

v0.0.6
 - Added fitter.py module

v0.0.5
 - added alos_obs(), pbdot_intr(), and intr_over_gr() to convenience submodule

v0.0.4
 - had to rework how some decorators work to avoid circular imports
 - @fix_arrays is now in glob.py (new)
 - @convert_to_frame is now in transforms.py
 - some bug fixes so that the decorators also worked for methods (python3 fix your game)
 - added some useful constants to glob.py

v0.0.3
 - borrowed some coordinate transforms from mwahpy
 - added transforms module
 - added convenience.pdot_shk() and convenience.dm_over_bary_alos()
 - added decorators module
 - borrowed the fix_arrays decorator from mwahpy

v0.0.2 
 - added convenience module
 - added pbdot_gr() function
 - did some sphinx testing

v0.0.1 (initial commit)
 - added potential models, plus .accel() and .alos() capabilities
