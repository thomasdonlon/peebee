 - added convenience.dot and convenience.mags helper functions
 - added CoxGomezSpiralArm potential to Models
 - changed UniformAccel Model to UniformAlos
 - added Uniform3DAccel Model
 - fixed bug in models.a_gal_sph() by changing np.put -> np.place, which can take conditions instead of indices
 - fixed bug in fit chi^2 statistic calculation, is now correct

 - changed a bunch of readthedocs and documentation stuff
 - changed the way that default/disabled parameters work to fix fitter.fit_model()
 - added model.get_param_default() method for some

 - borrowed some coordinate transforms from mwahpy
 - added transforms module
 - added convenience.pdot_shk() and convenience.dm_over_bary_alos()
